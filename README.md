## Project Overview
Nourasense provides a platform for doctors, admins, and patients to access infant health-related information and insights. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes data to detect deficiencies in infants' health and provide insights. The three main user dashboards are:
- **Doctor Dashboard**: For doctors to access and manage patient data, diagnose, and view reports.
- **Admin Dashboard**: For administrators to manage users and overall platform settings.
- **Patient Dashboard**: For patients to view their health data, reports, and track their progress.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides fast development and optimized builds.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different parts of the app.
- **React Query / TanStack Query**: For data fetching and state management.
- **Axios**: For making API requests.
- **React Hot Toast**: For displaying toast notifications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.
